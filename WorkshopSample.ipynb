      " The gel-rogan experience. The stuff in the sea very alienly on the back. Yeah. I agree. You know, they did some study recently where they showed that jellyfish, despite not having a brain, they seemed to be able to learn. Now they're not trying to figure out, well, how have they learned? I know how they learn. Vibes. Vibes, man. They feel the vibes. They feel the vibes. Yeah, because they don't have a brain to feel the vibes. What if we live in a vibrational universe where everything is frequency, it would make sense. They feel the vibes. They're not down there. They just go with what the flow is. They're very jelly-like. They just go with whatever the energy is doing already. That's why it seems like they know. You guys seem like you came up with this theory together and you discussed this? Well, I just thought of it right now and Sarah came on board with me and I feel like we're on to something. Yeah, we're on to something. Well, no, I think we live in a vibrational universe and things enter our experience based on the things that we think in the world that we create. And so when you think, if the fish are flowing this way, the jelly is going to go this way too. And it seems like they know what they're doing, but they're just kind of going with whatever is happening around them. Awesome. Some of them are poisonous as fuck, like the box jellyfish. Which means they know they need to be poisonous. Yeah. Which means they're aware that there's danger. So they're scenty in some way. Yeah, they have no brain, but they're aware. I know a lot of people like that. Yeah. I know a lot of jellyfish. Well, especially if you think about where box jellyfish live, they're australia, right? Australia has great white sharks everywhere. Australia has those little cute octopi that is octopus pie. I think it's octopi. Octopi that are the little blue-ringed ones that look like you can pick them up at the killio. They're like the most dangerous one in the world. It's not octopuses. That's a game's bomb movie. Octopuses. The blue-ringed octopus. Yeah, it's like very cute and small and they have videos of that one. That'll kill you. How come that guy has it on his head? It's like one of the most deadly octopus. Wow. It looks and people pick them up all the time because they're beautiful. I want that in a jacket. Yeah. What does it have a stinger? It bites, I think. If I remember correctly. It has a toxin or some sort. I think it bites. It's nickname bro. It says blue-ringed octopus. nickname bro. It only attacks humans when it feels in danger if you're trying to corner a blue-ringed octopus. That might be from a person in the attack. So there's two types of toxins for hunting the other for self-defense. It a blue-ringed octopus ejects tetrodoxin, a harmful toxin that could paralyze and kill a human adult in mere minutes. It's 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide. That's cyanide. It's crazy. That's wild. Holy shit. There's no known antidote. Nope. It's the same kind of toxin that puffer fish out. It can kill 26 full adults with one bite. Oh my god. It can kill 26 full adults in one bite. Yeah. That is so crazy. That is so insane. It is insane, right? And there's videos of people that pick it up. They think of viral because they don't know better. So they're playing with it in the ocean. Oh my god. And it's like, oh god. And thank god. I mean, I think that I think they've also had enough licks thing about how octopi are like really smart and they like have the average brain of like a five-year-old child or something. So maybe some of them are aware and don't want to kill people when they get picked up. Well, they figured out how to open up mason jars. Oh yeah. They can unlock doors. They can, I think they said that they can memorize shit. That's kind of cute. They can memorize shit and how it works. Well, they have this tank that was set up next to another tank. So one tank had octopus in it. The other tank across the room had fish in it. Fish started missing. Yeah. And so they set up a camera and they found out what was going on was the octopus was climbing out of his tank, walking across the floor, climbing up at the other tank, jacking a fish, eating it, and then going back into his tank. The comedian and me imagined it jacking off a fish and then eating it. But for some reason, when I was imagining it, the octopus was wearing sunglasses and the whole story. I mean, how insane is that? Did the thing figured out that it could get out and walk in a place where it can't breathe? Well, they can fit through anything that their eyes can fit through. That's great. No matter how big they are. Okay. Also. Don't quote me on that. But how would it know that it could get out and climb? I mean, what? You want to hear the answer? Yeah. The vibes. It just knows. The same way, the same way the everyone knows everything. Five. Five. Three times a day. You were like, this feels right? How is humans, the first two humans know to have sex? They were just like, this feels like we should do that. Right. Well, but it was way before humans, right? How did the first living organism that was multicellular figure out how to mate? A little, a little, a little innate thing, a little horny cell. Right. Little horny cells. So what is this octopus doing? Oh, big octopus versus small holes. They keep, they keep getting this. This is a porn, this is a porn, I'm bad at this. I'm tired. I'm sorry, guys. I'm tired. I'm tired. Is there a little pent-up energy in this room was happening? Big octopus, small hole is disgusting. So that little hole in the plexiglass, it's going to go through that little hole. Oh, yeah. And it could definitely fit, because the eyeballs are like a fist. It actually might, it did four other ones before I got to this video. So this is one of my stuck, yeah, I think it backs off. It realizes it's stuck. This is a fucking alien, I'm sorry. They are aliens. How is that not an alien? They really are aliens. They're just aliens that live under the ocean. Yeah. And do you know the myth of the cracking? Cracking was an enormous octopus that would take out ships. No. Yeah, it was always like one of those ancient myths of a sea beast. Yeah, they have paintings with like the octopus tentacles touching the ship and stuff. One day, one day they found tentacle imprints, the imprints of the suction cups that were massive, that would have indicated like an enormous octopus. Oh, yeah, they were definitely taking down ships. So the thing it was real. They think at one point in time, they really were massive octopus. They're smart enough to. What is that fossil, the fossilized version of the crackin? So they found these fossils of the suction cups on the bottom of the ocean floor. And they were like, what?\n"
